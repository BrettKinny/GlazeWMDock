/// <summary>
/// The single Dock band item that renders the whole workspace strip as live
/// <em>text on the bar</em> — the way the built-in Time &amp; Date and
/// Performance widgets do — instead of an icon that opens a flyout.
///
/// The Command Palette Dock renders each child item of a band inline, binding a
/// TextBlock to the item's <c>Title</c> (and a smaller one to <c>Subtitle</c>).
/// So the trick to getting dynamic text on the bar is to put the live text in
/// <c>Title</c>/<c>Subtitle</c> and mutate it in place: the toolkit's
/// <c>CommandItem</c> setters raise <c>PropChanged</c>, which the Dock observes
/// and re-renders. This is exactly the pattern the clock's <c>NowDockBand</c>
/// uses (it just assigns <c>Title = timeString; Subtitle = dateString;</c> on a
/// timer). Here the "tick" is a GlazeWM workspace/focus event instead.
///
/// On a multi-monitor setup the Command Palette Dock renders the same band on
/// every monitor — the SDK gives an extension no way to know which monitor a
/// band is painting on (<c>GetDockBands()</c> takes no monitor context) — so a
/// single strip is inevitably shared across all docks. To keep that shared strip
/// from looking like every monitor mirrors the same state, it shows each
/// monitor's workspaces as its own group, ordered left-to-right by physical
/// position. Each monitor's currently displayed workspace is the bold filled
/// circled digit; every other workspace is a plain digit. Which monitor has
/// focus is shown by the brackets: every monitor <em>except</em> the one you're
/// on is wrapped in <c>[brackets]</c>, so the un-bracketed group is where you
/// are. So <c>❸ 5 [1 2 4 ❻]</c> reads "I'm on this monitor, showing workspace 3
/// (which also has 5); the other monitor is showing 6 (and also has 1, 2, 4)."
/// Switching monitors just moves the brackets. On a single monitor there are no
/// brackets and it looks the way it always did. The focused workspace is also
/// named in the <c>Subtitle</c> (e.g. <c>Workspace 2</c>). Clicking the strip
/// opens the workspace switcher page.
